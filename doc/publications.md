## Abstract

In this paper, we present the NASA On-Board Artificial Intelligence Research (OnAIR) Platform, a dual-use tool for rapid prototyping autonomous capabilities for earth and space missions, serving as both a cognitive architecture and a software pipeline.
OnAIR has been used for autonomous reasoning in applications spanning various domains and implementation environments, supporting the use of raw data files, simulators, embodied agents, and recently in an onboard experimental flight payload.
We review the OnAIR architecture and recent applications of OnAIR for autonomous reasoning in various projects at NASA, concluding with a discussion on the intended use for the public domain, and directions for future work.
